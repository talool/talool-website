		<h2><span wicket:id="p1"></span> Sales Tracking!</h2>
		<p>
			In order to get credit for your <span wicket:id="p2"></span> sales in the Talool app
			(to track prizes earned or money raised toward individual accounts),
			you will need to generate your own tracking code by completing the form below.  
			You can generate as many of these tracking codes as you like (e.g. if you have multiple children selling 
			<span wicket:id="p4"></span> for a school fundraiser, you would want one tracking code for each child). 
		</p>
		<p>
			When you click on "Generate My Code", we will send you an email 
			with your tracking code and all the details you will need to get started raising
			money and earning credit for your <span wicket:id="p3"></span> sales.
