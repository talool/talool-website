			<h3><span class="orange-font">Step 2</span> Pass It On</h3>
			<p>

				you pass on these instructions.  Here are some ways we make it easy to share these
				instructions with others.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					After your purchase, you will see a red notification in Talool.  
					The image to the right shows an example of this. When you
					select that new message, the email client on your phone will open with these instructions
					already loaded in an email.  Just add some email addresses and hit send.  Super simple.
				</li>
				<li>
					Copy the URL for this page and share it with your friends.  Send it in an email, put it on facebook, 
					add it to your blog.  The more people who know, the better. 
				</li>
				<li>
					Sometimes a personal message is the most effective.  Now that you know how this process works,
					just craft your own message and spread the word.
