		<h2>Fundraising With Talool</h2>
		<p>
			Printing, shipping, and accounting for paper coupon books is a real pain when you're trying
			to run a successful fundraiser.  It is easy to see how going digital could improve the situation, but
			many groups have concerns about how to make that transition successfully.  That's where we
			come in.  Our online tools can help you get your digital fundraiser up and running quickly.  
			Our Pre-Paid Access and In-App Purchase options give you two ways to integrate our 
			mobile apps into your existing fundraiser process.  And, our innovative communication tools make initiating
			the fundraiser as easy as sending an email.

			Benefits include:

				<dt>Growing Sales</dt>
				<dd>
					Knowing your customer base is the first step to growing your sales.  With Talool you can always reach 
					the users who have purchased the mobile version of your book, so each year's sales benefits from the 
					year before it.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>In-App Payments -- Get Paid Right Away!</dt>
				<dd>
					We've integrated with Braintree (a property of PayPal) to ensure your customers have a world-class payment 
					experience, and you'll get the money you are raising as quickly as possible.  When a customer
					purchases a digital book in our apps, your proceeds are deposited into your bank account within 2
					days.  If you need to know who made each sale, we give you the tracking tools to make that possible too.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Pre-Paid Access Codes</dt>
				<dd>
					If you aren't ready to go 100% digital yet, you can sell paper coupon books AND access to digital books 
					in the Talool apps at the same time.   We give you the ability to generate as
					many Access Codes as you like, so you can offer pre-paid access to your content in our apps.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Social Graph</dt>
				<dd>
					Our Facebook integration and mobile email tools can make every book sale lead to many, many more.
					Each time a customer buys a book in our app we encourage them to share their support with their Facebook
					friends and their email contacts.
