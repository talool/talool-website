					If you're in the business of publishing deals without a mobile app, you know at least 3 big companies 
					eating your lunch.  You need stay competitive by giving your customers the experience they have come 
					to expect.  The Talool platform was built on the idea that by working together we can create something 
					more powerful than an individual Coupon app.  We can create stronger relationships between buyers and sellers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Payback Book has partnered with Talool for its 2013-2014 edition in Vancouver, WA and Boulder, CO.  
					By integrating the Talool app with their product, the Payback Book gets to experience the benefits of 
					Mobile without the financial risk of building and maintaining their own app.

				<h2>Platform Benefits</h2>
				<p>
					<b>Eliminate printing costs</b> <br/>
					You pay more than just the printer when publish a paper coupon book.  And the consignment distribution model forces you 
					to print, ship, and store many more books than you ever sell.  Wouldn't it be nice to eliminate or even reduce those costs.
					Talool can help you transition away from that waste and improve your margins.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Shorter time to market</b> <br/>
					It takes a lot of time to design, proof, and print your books.  And if you want to make a change, or add a new 
					merchant or deal after you've gone to print, you're out of luck until you do it all over with the next year's book.  
					With Talool it's easy to add new merchants and deals any time throughout the year.
				</p>
				<p>
					<!-- This is very Fundraising specific.  Work on making it apply to the general case too. -->
					<b>Easier sales process for you and your customers</b> <br/>
					You start over each year selling your books.  You lose a lot of happy customers, and are forced try to 
					replace them with a new group.  Unless you sign up more schools or fundraising organizations, your sales will stay flat.
					Why limit sales to your direct fundraising efforts when you can open up the next level of indirect sales through your users
					actions on the Talool Platform.  With Talool you can always reach the users who have purchase the mobile version of you book, 
					so each year's sales benefits from the year before it.  Plus we give you the online tools needed to support the efforts of 
					the schools and organizations you work with.  And when users redeem and share your deals, their friends are encouraged to get
					their own copy of your book.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Powerful analytics</b> <br/>
					Merchants want the ability to measure the success of the offers you distribute.  With Talool you'll create deals that are 
					more than just marketing; We power deals that help you learn about existing customers and identify the new customers 
					waiting to be discovered.
