		<h2>Powerful Tools and Analytics</h2>
		<p>
		Talool is not just a mobile app, it's a platform that can help connect you with existing customers 
		and those waiting to be discovered.  Talool learns customers' habits: what they like, what they 
		don't like, where they like to shop most and when.  This powerful information allows merchants to 
		customize their communications to the right audience and identify prospects. With Talool, there's no 
		more wondering whether certain offers will pay off.  We will provide the metrics to prove it and you 
		can adjust your offers along the way.

		<h2>Rethink Fundraising</h2>
		<p>
		If you're selling coupon books as part of a fundraiser, you probably feel like you're starting over 
		each year with a new customer base. You lose a lot of happy customers because you have no direct 
		connection to them. With Talool you can always reach the users who have purchased the mobile version 
		of your book, so each year's sales benefits from the year before it.
