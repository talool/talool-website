			<dt>How do customers get my coupons?</dt>
			<dd>
				Throughout the year schools in your area kick off several fundraisers.  The majority of them happen at 
				the start of the school year, and that is when parents and students encourage their friends and families
				to purchase a digital coupon book in the Talool App for iOS and Android.  
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Is the Talool App Free?</dt>
			<dd>
				Yes, it is free for both iOS and Android.  
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Can my deals be abused in the Talool App?</dt>
			<dd>
				Talool ensures that deals can not be duplicated or redeemed multiple times.  When a deal is redeemed it 
				is tracked on our servers and a unique redemption code is clearly displayed on the coupon along with 
				the time of the redemption.  
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Will I be able to see which customers redeem my deals?</dt>
			<dd>
				Yes.  You will access to real time reports of the customers who redeemed your deals and when each redemption 
				happened.
			</dd>
			
			<dt>Do I have to pay to publish my coupons in Talool?</dt>
			<dd>
				No.  Merchants can publish as many coupons as they like for free.
