		<h2>Talool Tools &amp; Analytics</h2>
		<p>
			We've invested a lot of our time and energy to make sure our admin tools can save you even
			more time and energy.  We know it takes a lot to design, proof, and publish deals for paper
			distribution.  The Talool platform gives you visual tools that allow you to push digital deals to 
			customers in moments.  And unlike paper, you'll have real-time feedback on who is using the
			deals you publish, and the ability to immediately make changes to optimize your offers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Talool Tools include:
			<dl>
				<dt>Content Wizards</dt>
				<dd>
					The Talool admin provides easy to use Wizards that give you step by step 
					guidance for managing all the information and images supporting your business
					and your deals.  You'll get to see how your content will appear in the apps before
					you publish it.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Stock Photos</dt>
				<dd>
					Talool provides a library of fully licensed stock images that are categorized and 
					optimized for use in our apps.  We make it easy to quickly find an image that will 
					make your offer look great.  And if you already have images you love, you can 
					quickly upload them to Talool for use in the apps.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Real-time Analytics</dt>
				<dd>
					We collect a lot of data, and we want you to be able to use it.  Whether you're looking 
					for trends in customer behavior, the details of a recent coupon redemption, or the name 
					of a past customer, our tools will make it easy to find what you need.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Fundraiser Tracking</dt>
				<dd>
					When you use our platform to support a fundraiser, we give you tools to track your sales back
					to a specific organization or member of an organization.  Monitoring the performance of your
					fundraiser in real-time gives you powerful information to help maximize the money you help 
					raise.
