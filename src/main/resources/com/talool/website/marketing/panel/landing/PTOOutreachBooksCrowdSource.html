		<h2>Raise More, Work Less</h2>
		<p>
			Talool works with organizations around the country to improve their annual fundraisers.  
			Our goal is to change the economics of coupon book fundraising so that a higher percentage of 
			the proceeds go to you, the groups raising the funds.  Traditionally, that percentage has been
			50% when paper coupon books are involved.  
			
			<span class="highlight">The base percentage given to fundraising organizations
			using Talool is 75%, and it can grow as high as <span wicket:id="percentage1"></span>%.</span>
		</p>
		
		<h3>A Turn-Key Solution</h3>
		<p>
			We want to make fundraising as simple as possible, so we give you easy to use tools that allow
			you to set up and launch your campaign with a simple online form.  
			
			You'll be able to track sales down to each 
			individual in your organization, and 
			<span class="highlight">get paid directly as each purchase happens</span>.  
			
			You can start selling the 
			digital coupon books through the Talool apps anytime you're ready, and we'll pay you 75% of
			of the proceeds from each sale.  Since most books sell for $20 and credit card processing fees 
			are less than $1, 
			<span class="highlight">you could be making over $14 on each book sold</span>.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Increase Your Return To <span wicket:id="percentage2"></span>%</h3>
		<p>
			Many organizations like yours already have relationships with local businesses, so we 
			give you an easy way to increase your cut of the sales.  Just sign up 15 local businesses
			to be part of the digital books you plan to sell and Talool will increase your return to 
			<span wicket:id="percentage3"></span>%.  
			
			At that rate, 
			<span class="highlight">you could be making over $<span wicket:id="dollars"></span> on each book sold</span>.

		<h2>It Starts With An Email</h2>
		<p>
			You just need to email your organization to install the Talool app and make a purchase with an 
			assigned tracking code.  All the door-to-door selling is gone, because the same instructions apply 
			to selling to friends and family.  
			<div class="sampleEmailContainer notOnMobile">
				<a>Here's an example of that email.</a>
				<div class="sampleEmail">
					It's time again for our annual fundraiser, and this year we are offering a wonderful collection 
					of discounts to many of the local businesses you visit every week.  There are over $500 in savings
					available in this collection which is available for only $20.  To show your support of 
					<i>[Your Organization]</i> please install the <a href="talool.com/download">Talool App</a> and
					purchase the <i>[Book Name]</i>.  Don't forget to enter our tracking code, <B>Q6DJHW</B>, 
					when you make your purchase, so <b>90%</b> of the proceeds can be sent to <i>[Your Organization]</i>.
					<br/><br/>
					Please remember to thank all the local business who participated.

		<h3>Each Purchase Drives More Sales</h3>
		<p>
			Each customer who buys a coupon book on your behalf is delivered a special message encouraging them
			to email their friends and family to do the same.  In addition, customers who signed in to Talool with Facebook
			have those same instructions posted to their Facebook page.  Your fundraiser will reach many more people
			than you ever imagined.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Watch It Happen</h3>
		<p>
			And here's the fun part.  You can log in to your account at Talool and watch those sales being recorded
			in our system as they happen.  You'll know exactly how your fundraiser is performing at any time.  You'll 
			also know who supported your organization, so you can reach out them the next time you sell coupon books 
			on Talool.
