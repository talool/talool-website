  <h2>Consent</h2>
	<p>
		By registering as a Talool Merchant and using the Talool Tools website to publish deals on the Talool apps, 
		or using any other services we offer from time to time in connection with any of the foregoing 
		(collectively, the "Application"), you (the "Merchant") agree to the rules and policies set forth in 
		this Merchant Agreement posted during your use of the Application.
	</p>
	<h2>Merchant Responsibilities</h2>
	<p>
		The Merchant understands that deals are sold as part of a digital book (the "Book") to support fundraisers in 
		the community where you operate your business.
		If the Merchant contributes deals for a Book, the Merchant agrees to honor and accept those deals for the term defined
		by the Book's expiration date.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Merchant understands that their agreement to participate in a Book automatically renews after the Book's expiration date 
		and any previously defined deals will be included in a new version of the Book, 
		unless the Merchant notifies Talool of their intent to cancel participation by June 1st of each year.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Merchant agrees to honor the discounts according the terms defined with Talool.  
		These terms are clearly listed on each deal, but are subject to change at the discretion of the Merchant.
	</p>
	<h2>Other Things to be Aware of</h2>
	<p>
		IN NO EVENT SHALL TALOOL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, 
		CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFIT DAMAGES ARISING FROM 
		YOUR USE OF THE TALOOL APPLICATION, EVEN IF TALOOL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
		NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED HEREIN, TALOOL'S LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CAUSE 
		WHATSOEVER AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE ACTION, WILL AT ALL TIMES BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID, IF ANY, 
		BY YOU TO TALOOL FOR THE TALOOL SERVICES DURING THE TERM OF MEMBERSHIP.
	</p>
	<p>
		This Merchant Agreement can change. 
		We may announce if any "big" changes are made, but so long as you've used the Application after the change, regardless of any 
		separate notice, you agree to the current posted version of this Merchant Agreement.
