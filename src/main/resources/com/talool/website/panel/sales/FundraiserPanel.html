	<h2>Grow Your Profits!</h2>
	<p>
		You work so hard for your non-profit.  Selling coupon books is just another example of what you do to raise money.
		However, it becomes difficult to keep track of all those books.  How many units did each person sell?  How many did
		you lose?  With Talool, there's no need to keep track of books -- the sales are automated and tracked for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		<!-- This is very Fundraising specific.  Work on making it apply to the general case too. -->
		<b>Easier sales process for you and your customers</b> <br/>
		You start over each year selling your books.  You lose a lot of happy customers, and are forced try to 
		replace them with a new group.  Unless you sign up more schools or fundraising organizations, your sales will stay flat.
		Why limit sales to your direct fundraising efforts when you can open up the next level of indirect sales through your users
		actions on the Talool Platform.  With Talool you can always reach the users who have purchase the mobile version of you book, 
		so each year's sales benefits from the year before it.  Plus we give you the online tools needed to support the efforts of 
		the schools and organizations you work with.  And when users redeem and share your deals, their friends are encouraged to get
		their own copy of your book.

	<div class="notOnMobile" style="background:#eee; margin: 10px 0 30px; padding: 50px">this is a big point.  let's make it visual.  see if we can make 
	it less fundraising specific, or move it to that page.</div>
	<p>
		<b>More value to your customers</b>
		Talool gives customers a greater level of confidence that they will be able to use the coupons they've purchased 
		from you.  They will be more likely to support your fundraiser since they know that the money they're spending
		provides value to your non-profit and value to them.
