		<h2>Fundraising With Talool</h2>
		<p>
			Printing, shipping, and accounting for paper coupon books is a real pain when you're trying
			to run a successful fundraiser.  It is easy to see how going digital could improve the situation, but
			many people have concerns about the costs and risks associated with that transition.  That's where we
			come in.  Our free trial and revenue share pricing model helps you mitigate those risks.  And our Pre-Paid Access
			and In-App Purchase options give you two ways to integrate our mobile apps into your existing fundraiser process.
		</p>
		<p>
			Benefits include:
			<dl>
				<dt>Growing Sales</dt>
				<dd>
					Knowing your customer base is the first step to growing your sales.  With Talool you can always reach 
					the users who have purchased the mobile version of your book, so each year's sales benefits from the 
					year before it.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Social Graph</dt>
				<dd>
					Our Facebook integration and mobile email tools can make every book sale lead to many, many more.
					Each time a customer buys a book in our app we encourage them to share their support with their Facebook
					friends and their email contacts.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>Pre-Paid Access Codes</dt>
				<dd>
					If you want to see paper coupon books and access to digital books in the Talool apps at the same time, you 
					may want to give customers an Access Code at the time of purchase.  We give you the ability to generate as
					many Access Codes as you like, so you can offer pre-paid access to your content in our apps.
				</dd>
				
				<dt>In-App Payments</dt>
				<dd>
					If in-app purchases are what you're looking for, you can give your fundraising organizations individual 
					Tracking Codes.  We give you the ability to generate as many Tracking Codes as you need, so you can
					monitor and account for all sales.  In addition, we've integrated with Braintree (a property of PayPal) 
					to ensure your customers have a world-class payment 
					experience, and you'll have the lowest credit card processing fees possible.
