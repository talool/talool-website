	<h2>Connect With Your Customers</h2>
	<p>
		Many coupon book publishers promise you increased traffic from their deal books.  The publishers that use 
		Talool can actually prove it. Talool is not just a mobile app, it's a platform that can help connect you 
		with existing customers and those waiting to be discovered.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Powerful analytics</b> <br/>
		Talool utilizes new tools that learn which customers like what you have to offer, allowing you to get to 
		know your customers better and adjust your marketing to target the right audience.  Talool can then use this 
		information to identify prospective customers that match a similar profile and help convert them into new 
		customers for you.  Converting a qualified prospect into a customer is more likely to yield a long-term, loyal, 
		fan.  With Talool, there's no more wondering whether the offers you're providing to publishers are paying off - 
		we will provide the metrics to prove it and can adjust the offers along the way.
