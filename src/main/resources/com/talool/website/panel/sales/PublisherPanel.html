	<h2>Make your coupon book Mobile!</h2>
	<p>
		If you're in the business of publishing deals without a mobile app, you know at least 3 big companies 
		eating your lunch.  You need to stay competitive by giving your customers the experience they have come 
		to expect.  The Talool platform was built on the idea that by working together we can create something 
		more powerful than an individual Coupon app.  We can create stronger relationships between buyers and sellers.

	<div class="notOnMobile" style="background:#eee; margin: 10px 0 30px; padding: 50px">show the logos of the big guys like Groupon, 
	Living Social, Entertainment.  Compare to a bunch of little guys joining together to be larger.</div>
	<h2>Platform Benefits</h2>
	<p>
		<b>Eliminate printing costs</b> <br/>
		You pay the printer, the freight company, the warehouse , a designer and perhaps many others to publish 
		your paper coupons. Talool can reduce or even eliminate these costs, help you transition away from that 
		waste and improve your margins.

	<p>
		<b>Shorter time to market</b> <br/>
		It takes a lot of time to design, proof, and print your books.  And, if you want to edit after its gone to 
		print, you're out of luck until your next print run.  With Talool, edits are easy to make any time.
		You can even add new merchants and deals whenever you want.

		<!-- This is very Fundraising specific.  Work on making it apply to the general case too. -->
		<b>Easier sales process for you and your customers</b> <br/>
		You start over each year selling your books.  You lose a lot of happy customers, and are forced try to 
		replace them with a new group.  Unless you sign up more schools or fundraising organizations, your sales will stay flat.
		Why limit sales to your direct fundraising efforts when you can open up the next level of indirect sales through your users
		actions on the Talool Platform.  With Talool you can always reach the users who have purchase the mobile version of you book, 
		so each year's sales benefits from the year before it.  Plus we give you the online tools needed to support the efforts of 
		the schools and organizations you work with.  And when users redeem and share your deals, their friends are encouraged to get
		their own copy of your book.
	</p>
	<div class="notOnMobile" style="background:#eee; margin: 10px 0 30px; padding: 50px">this is a big point.  let's make it visual.  see if we can make 
	it less fundraising specific, or move it to that page.</div>
	<p>
		<b>Powerful analytics</b> <br/>
		Merchants want the ability to measure the success of the offers you distribute.  With Talool you'll create deals that are 
		more than just marketing; We power deals that help you learn about existing customers and identify the new customers 
		waiting to be discovered.
