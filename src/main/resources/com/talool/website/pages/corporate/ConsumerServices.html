		<h2>PayBack Adds Mobile!</h2>
		<p>
			Payback has partnered with Talool, a mobile app that makes it easier and more fun to redeem your Payback coupons.  
			While some offers from this book are not currently in the mobile app, we will be adding Bonus Deals throughout the year.  
		</p>
		<h2>Never be without your Payback coupons again! </h2>
		<p>
			You may occasionally leave the house without your Payback book, but you seldom leave without your mobile phone.  
			With the Talool app,  you will always be ready to save money when you visit our participating merchants. 
		</p>
		<h2>Share your coupons!</h2>
		<p>
			Talool makes it easy to share your coupons with friends, just like a paper coupon.  Now all you have to do is pick an email 
			or Facebook friend from your phone.  Your friends will thank you! 
		</p>
		<h2>How To Redeem Your Deals</h2>
		<p>
			Simply show your digital coupon to the participating merchant and tap the screen to select the redeem button.  Once redeemed, 
			the merchant may wish to write down the redemption code that is displayed on your phone.
