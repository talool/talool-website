		<h2>Raise More, Work Less</h2>
		<p>
			Talool works with organizations around the country to improve their annual fundraisers.  
			Our goal is to change the economics of coupon book fundraising so that a higher percentage of 
			the proceeds go to you, the groups raising the funds.  
			
			<span class="highlight">The base percentage given to fundraising organizations
			using Talool is 75%, and it can grow as high as <span wicket:id="percentage1"></span>%.</span>
		</p>
		
		<h3>A Turn-Key Solution</h3>
		<p>
			We want to make fundraising as simple as possible, so we give you easy to use tools that allow
			you to set up and launch your campaign with a simple online form.  
			
			You'll be able to track sales down to each 
			individual in your organization, and 
			<span class="highlight">get paid directly as each purchase happens</span>.  
			
			You can start selling the 
			digital coupon books through the Talool apps anytime you're ready, and we'll pay you 75% of
			the proceeds from each sale.  
		</p>
		
		<h3>Increase Your Return To <span wicket:id="percentage2"></span>%</h3>
		<p>
			Many organizations like yours already have relationships with local businesses, so we 
			give you an easy way to increase your cut of the sales.  Just sign up 15 local businesses
			to be part of the digital books you plan to sell and Talool will increase your return to 
			<span wicket:id="percentage3"></span>%.

		<h2>It Starts With An Email</h2>
		<p>
			It just takes a simple email your community to get customers to sign up.  
			All the door-to-door selling is gone.
			Talool has examples of emails to help make your sales job that much easier.  
		</p>
		
		<h3>Each Purchase Drives Sales</h3>
		<p>
			Each customer who buys a coupon book on your behalf is delivered a special message encouraging them
			to email their friends and family to do the same.  In addition, customers who signed in to Talool with Facebook
			have those same instructions posted to their Facebook page.  Your fundraiser will reach many more people
			than you ever imagined.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Watch It Happen</h3>
		<p>
			And here's the fun part.  
			You can log in to your account at Talool and watch those sales add up in real time, so  
			you can know exactly how your fundraiser is performing as it's happening.  
			You'll also know who supported your organization, so you can thank them and reach out them the next time 
			you sell coupon books on Talool.
