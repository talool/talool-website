	<h2>Grow Your Profits!</h2>
	<p>
		If you're selling coupon books as part of a fundraiser, you probably feel like you're starting over each year with a new 
		customer base.  You lose a lot of happy customers because you have no direct connection to them.  
		With Talool you can always reach the users who have purchased the 
		mobile version of your book, so each year's sales benefits from the year before it.

		<b>An easier sales process</b><br/>
		Running a coupon book fundraiser is hard.  It can be difficult to keep track of all those books.  
		How many units did each person sell?  How many did you lose?  With Talool, there's no need to keep track of books;
		the sales are automated and tracked for you.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>More value to your customers</b><br/>
		Talool gives customers a greater level of confidence that they will be able to use the coupons they've purchased 
		from you.  They will be more likely to support your fundraiser since they know that the money they're spending
		provides value to your non-profit and value to them.
