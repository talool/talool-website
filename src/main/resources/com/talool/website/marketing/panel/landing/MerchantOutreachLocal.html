		<h2>Help Support Your Local Schools</h2>
		<p>
			Talool works with the schools in your area to improve their 
			annual fundraisers.  In the past, Parent Teacher Organizations have sold paper coupon books and only received
			50% of the proceeds to support their schools.  <b>We feel they should get <span wicket:id="percentage"></span>% 
			of the proceeds.</b>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			If you agree and would like to help the schools in your community, please consider contributing one or more
			coupons to your business.  If you already publish coupons in your community, you can contribute the same
			offers for this cause.  If you don't typically offer discounts, please consider contacting us to find other 
			ways you can help.  Marketing to the parents in your community can be a great way to increase the traffic to 
			your business.
