		<h2>White Label: Your Brand Powered By Talool</h2>
		<p>
			Talool makes it easy to get all the benefits of our platform, and still promote your brand.  You give us an app icon, 
			color palette, and a few images, and we'll take care of the rest.  When we're done, you'll have a licensed version of our apps 
			available in Apple's App Store and in Google Play. We'll also manage the hard stuff like app updates and scaling servers to 
			ensure your customers get a great experience.
