				<h2>"I visit these merchants every week, but I never have my coupon book with me!"</h2>
				<p>
					Talool supports the fundraising efforts of schools and organizations in Vancouver, WA and Boulder, CO 
					by migrating traditional paper coupon books they sell into a fun and convenient mobile app. 
					If you enjoy saving money as much as you like supporting your local community, please 
					join us on Talool.
				</p>
				<h2>Never be without your deals again!</h2>
				<p>
					You may occasionally leave the house without your coupon book, but you seldom leave 
					without your mobile phone.  With Talool you will always be ready to save money when 
					you visit our participating merchants. 
				</p>
				<h2>Share your deals!</h2>
				<p>
					Talool makes it easy to give your deals to friends, just like a paper coupon.  
					Now all you have to do is pick an email or Facebook friend from your phone.  Your 
					friends will thank you for the gift!

				<h2>"We'd like to help you make your coupon book Mobile!"</h2>
				<p>
					If you're in the business of publishing deals without a mobile app, you know at least 3 big companies 
					eating your lunch.  You need stay competitive by giving your customers the experience they have come 
					to expect.  The Talool platform was built on the idea that by working together we can create something 
					more powerful than an individual Coupon app.  We can create stronger relationships between buyers and sellers.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Payback Book has partnered with Talool for its 2013-2014 edition in Vancouver, WA and Boulder, CO.  
					By integrating the Talool app with their product, the Payback Book gets to experience the benefits of 
					Mobile without the financial risk of building and maintaining their own app.
