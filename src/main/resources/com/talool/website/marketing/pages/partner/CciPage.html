			<h2>Powerful Tools and Analytics</h2>
			<p>
			Talool is not just a mobile app, it is a platform that can help connect you with existing customers 
			and those waiting to be discovered.  Talool learns customers' habits: what they like, what they 
			don't like, where they like to shop most and when.  This powerful information allows merchants to 
			customize their communications to the right audience and identify prospects. With Talool, there's no 
			more wondering whether certain offers will pay off.  We will provide the metrics to prove it and you 
			can adjust your offers along the way.
