	<h2>"I visit these merchants every week, but I never have my coupon book with me!"</h2>
	<p>
		Talool migrates traditional paper coupons into a fun and convenient mobile app. 
		If you enjoy saving money as much as you  like supporting your local community, 
		please join us on Talool.
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Never be without your deals</b><br/>
		You may occasionally leave the house without your coupons, but you seldom leave 
		without your mobile phone.  With Talool, you will always be ready to save money when 
		you visit our participating merchants. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Share your deals</b><br/>
		Talool makes it easy to give your deals to friends, just like a paper coupon by 
		simply picking an email or Facebook friend from your phone.  Your friends will thank 
		you for the gift!
