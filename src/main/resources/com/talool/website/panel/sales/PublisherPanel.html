	<h2>Go Mobile!</h2>
	<p>
		If you're publishing deals without a mobile app, you know at least 3 big companies
		encroaching on your turf.  You need to stay competitive by giving your customers the experience they have come 
		to expect.  Talool was built to create something more powerful than an individual Coupon app.  
		We create stronger relationships between buyers and sellers.

	<div class="notOnMobile" style="background:#eee; margin: 10px 0 30px; padding: 50px">show the logos of the big guys like Groupon, 
	Living Social, Entertainment.  Compare to a bunch of little guys joining together to be larger.</div>

		<b>Reduce your costs</b> <br/>
		You pay the printer, the freight company, the warehouse, a designer and perhaps many others to publish 
		your paper coupons. Talool can help you reduce or even eliminate those costs, and transition away from 
		the old business model of pushing paper.

		<b>Shorter time to market</b> <br/>
		It takes a lot of time to design, proof, and print your books.  And, if you want to edit after its gone to 
		print, you're out of luck until your next print run.  With Talool, edits are easy to make any time.

		<b>Powerful analytics</b> <br/>
		Merchants want the ability to measure the success of the offers you distribute.  With Talool you'll create deals that are 
		more than just marketing; We power deals that help you learn about existing customers and identify the new customers 
		waiting to be discovered.  You'll attract and retain more merchants when you can provide more of the information them expect.
