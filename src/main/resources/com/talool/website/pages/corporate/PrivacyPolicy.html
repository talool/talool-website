			When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Application and to which pages within 
			the Application), we only use such data in aggregate form, in a manner that assures your anonymity. We may provide this aggregate 
			usage information to our partners; our partners may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use 
			our Application, so that our partners, too, can endeavor to provide you with an optimal experience.

			We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with laws; enforce 
			or apply our conditions of use and/or other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Talool, our employees, 
			our users, or others. We may exchange information with other companies and organizations (including governmental 
			authorities) for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
